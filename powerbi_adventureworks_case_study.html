    <h2>AdventureWorks Sales Dashboard in Power BI</h2>
    <p>
      This project is a Power BI report designed for performance monitoring and decision support. It tracks sales growth, profitability, orders, and returns, then allows drill down by product, region, and customer. I also built a pricing simulation so users can test how price changes may affect profit and target performance.

    <h3>The problem</h3>
    <p>
      Leadership needs one report that answers three questions quickly. Are we growing, what is driving results, and what decisions can we test before acting.
    </p>

    <h3>What I built</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Executive page with revenue, profit, orders, and return rate plus category and product drivers</li>
      <li>Geography page to compare regional performance and concentration of demand</li>
      <li>Product page with targets and a pricing slider to simulate adjusted profit</li>
      <li>Customer page showing unique customers, revenue per customer, top customers, and segmentation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key insights from the report</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Performance is strong overall, but return patterns still matter because returns can quietly reduce margin</li>
      <li>Accessories drive the highest order volume, indicating add ons are a major demand engine</li>
      <li>Shorts show the highest return tendency, which suggests a clear opportunity for fit, sizing, or expectation improvements</li>
      <li>Demand is concentrated in a few regions, so regional planning is important for marketing and inventory efficiency</li>
      <li>The pricing simulator helps quantify profit sensitivity and supports product level trade off conversations</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tools used</h3>
    <p>
      Power BI, Power Query, DAX, data modelling
