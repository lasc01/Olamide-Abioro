          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p>I currently work as a Data Analyst at Imola Schools in 
            Lagos, Nigeria. I have a strong passion for analyzing 
            complex data and turning it into meaningful insights that 
            can drive informed decision <br>
            I discovered my passion for IT during the COVID-19 lockdown, 
            which led me to explore various IT courses, including web design, 
            graphic design, and web development. In 2022, I decided to pursue a 
            career in data analytics. Thanks to the coding skills I had already 
            gained from my web development courses, transitioning into data 
            analytics was a smooth process. To further solidify my skills, 
            I took on a one-year internship in 2023, which lasted from January 
            2023 to January 2024. Following the internship, I secured a position 
            as a Data Analyst at Imola Schools in January 2024, where I am 
            currently employed. <br>
            I am proficient in data cleaning, data manipulation, data visualization, 
            analytical thinking, report writing, and more, using up-to-date tools 
            like Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib), Excel, SQL, and others. <br>
            One of my key achievements as a data analyst was creating a form to 
            gather data from the parents of students at my school. Through 
            analyzing this data, I discovered that most parents were either 
            traders or civil servants, which meant they had irregular income 
            streams. Based on these insights, I developed a tailored payment 
            plan where traders could make weekly payments, and civil servants 
            could pay monthly. This application of data analytics significantly 
            improved the school’s cash flow management.
