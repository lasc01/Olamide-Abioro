          <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>
          I am a data analyst with over four years of experience delivering BI reporting, dashboards, and decision ready insights using SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and advanced Excel.
          My style is practical. I care about clean pipelines, sensible metrics, and outputs that people trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work comfortably across the full analytics flow, from extraction and validation to modelling and reporting.
          If a dataset is messy, it is fine. I actually enjoy that part. Missing intervals, duplicated timestamps, sensor dropouts, outlier spikes, inconsistent classifications.
          Those details matter, because they change the story.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently working in transport data at Tracsis in Ireland, where quality assurance and disciplined reporting are not optional.
          The goal is simple, ship accurate client outputs, document what changed, and keep everything audit ready.

          <!-- <p>I’m currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Analytics at the National College of Ireland, 
            building on my academic background in Physics, which I completed in 2019. My journey into the world 
            of data hasn’t been entirely linear—but then again, not all good stories are. 
              <br>
            During the COVID-19 lockdown, like many people, I found myself re-evaluating my path. That quiet 
            period gave me the space to discover a deep interest in tech. I started experimenting with web 
            design and development, dipped my toes into graphic design, and before I knew it, I was hooked. 
            The logical structures and problem-solving aspects of coding fascinated me. That curiosity soon 
            evolved into a commitment, and by 2022, I made the decision to focus on data analytics as a career. 
              <br>
            In 2023, I took on a year-long internship as a Data Analyst, where I got hands-on experience turning 
            raw data into actionable insights. That internship solidified everything I had been learning and 
            gave me the confidence to move forward. Since January 2024, I’ve been working as a Data Analyst 
            at Imola Schools in Lagos, Nigeria, where I help make sense of data to support real-world decision-making. 
              <br>
            My current postgraduate studies cover a range of topics including Analytics Programming and Visualization, 
            Data Mining and Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Generative AI, Business Analytics, Business Intelligence, 
            Modelling and Simulation, and Statistics and Optimization. Each of these modules sharpens a different facet 
            of how I think about data, from digging into algorithms to understanding business context.
              <br>
            I’m proficient in Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib), SQL, Excel, Power BI and other tools that help me clean, manipulate, 
            and visualize data. But beyond the tools, I like to think of myself as someone who’s genuinely curious and enjoys 
            solving problems and finding patterns others might overlook.
              <br>
            One of my proudest moments came when I developed a digital form to collect data from parents at my school. 
            Analyzing the responses, I realized most of them were either traders or civil servants by professions with 
            unpredictable income patterns. Using that insight, I proposed a flexible payment plan: weekly installments 
            for traders and monthly for civil servants. It wasn’t a complex algorithm, but it had a real impact. That 
            change helped stabilize the school’s cash flow, and to me, that’s the kind of meaningful outcome data should 
            lead to.
             <br>
            At the heart of what I do is a simple idea: data should tell a story, and that story should drive action.
